Another idea, I talked to Zigx89, Devs jnr, Des Rose, and a few of the others, (you know i had to mention specific people.

Okay, so the idea was a faction system. Now i know you dont like factions claiming land. We dont need that.
But having groups of factions for pvp events, and other types of things, such as castle wars, would be awesome.
I have found the common faction system most servers use on dev.bukkit:http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/factions/
With this, I will be working on a new large pvp arena, becasue the current one is boring, and I will let you know when its finished.
